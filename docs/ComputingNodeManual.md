## Abstract

Here will introduce how to install the Computing Node App on the mobile phone by which integrate idle computing power to ZeroHybrid. And use tools to monitor resource consuming and check rewards.

Computing Node App currently supports Android phones with ARM v8a and v7a architecture CPUs.

## Installation

You can download apk from [here](https://github.com/ZeroHybrid-Network/MobileNodeApp/blob/main/docs/packages/zh-app-preview_068_sol_sign.apk "Download APK of computing node").

### Monitor Panel

After lanuched computing node, there will show the monitor panel.

The number of parallel VCU Slots can be set according to the performance of the phone. Note that it should be set according to the actual hardware cores, otherwise the computing performance would decrease, which would affect the rewards significantly.

The other system information are read-only.

### Rewards model

The reward model is calculated based on each Task and the execution time of the task. It will continue to be revised at the test network.

### Testnet policies

The testnet will be reset several times in order to upgrade for functionality and reliability. We will announce the token inheritance rules in time.
